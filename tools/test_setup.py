Run this script to verify that:
1) All necessary packages are installed
2) The packages are sufficiently recent
3) User options are specified correctly



Jim's Note: I've found managing python packages, particularly on Windows, to
be frustratingly complex. It is possible that this process could be enhanced
but the main goal of this script is to verify the setup rather than automate
the setup. That being said, help with automating the setup would be appreciated.

Manual user config specification
--------------------------------
Some settings must be set manually by the user. To do this make a copy of the
user_config_example.txt file in the open-worm-analysis-toolbox folder and rename
it in the same folder as user_config.py

Replace all values in the this file with their appropriate values.
