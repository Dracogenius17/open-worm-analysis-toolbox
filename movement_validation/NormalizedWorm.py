        For each section, we begin at its center on both sides of the contour. We then
        walk, pixel by pixel, in either direction until we hit the end of the section on
        opposite sides, for both directions. The midpoint, between each opposing pixel
        pair, is considered the skeleton and the distance between these pixel pairs is
        considered the width for each skeleton point.

        contour. When no spikes are present, our walk attempts to minimize the width
        between opposing pairs of pixels. When a spike is present, this strategy may
        cause one side to get stuck in the spike while the opposing side walks.

        Notes

        To perform this matrix multiplication we are multiplying:
          rot_matrix * s
        This is shape 2 x 2 x n, times 2 x 49 x n.
        Basically we want the first matrix treated as two-dimensional,
        and the second matrix treated as one-dimensional,
        with the results applied elementwise in the other dimensions.

        To make this work I believe we need to pre-broadcast rot_matrix into
        the skeleton points dimension (the one with 49 points) so that we have
          2 x 2 x 49 x n, times 2 x 49 x n
